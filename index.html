<h2 > About me </h2>
<p> I'm Abdulaziz Nassar, a 16-year-old Saudi student. I live in Jeddah on the west coast of Saudi Arabia. My main hobby is writing, and I mainly write stories. You can check my profile at FanFiction <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2833633/Giga-Crusher" target="_blank"> here.</a> (Note: This is not all of my work)
My favourite Food is Pizza, I developed fondness for Pizza when I traveled to Italy, I used to eat Pizza every day, my favourite one was mushroom Pizza.
My favourite International team (other than Saudi Arabia, of course) is Brazil. In my opinion, they are the best team to ever play football, and they produced legends In every position like: Dida, Cafu, Ronaldinho and Pele. They've been world champions 5 times, more than any other country, and I supported them since I was a little kid.
The coolest city I've been in is Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. It's has many cool places like the The Twin Towers, The Manara Tower, The KL bird park, and many more like hotels, malls, and restaurants. It's a bit crowded, but the best part about it is that it has a lot of Muslims, so I didn't feel that much of a cultural difference.

<div class="slender">
    <h3 class="slenderheader">Slender</h3>
    <blockquote>"Slender is a short, experimental horror game in which you must travel into the dark woods at night, <br>
     with a simple goal: Find 8 pages that are scattered across the woods. But as you are looking for them, <br>
     you are being stalked by an entity that grows more persistent and relentless as each page is collected,<br>
      an entity that you cannot even look at for long, let alone fight.<br> Your only hope is to collect all 8 pages before it catches you..."<br>
       -The official Slender game website</blockquote>
    <p class="slenderdiscription">I actually heard about this game from <a href="http://9gag.com" target="_blank"> 9gag</a>. And when I tried it, it didn't run properly on my computer. So I searched for it on Youtube, and that's how I found my Favourie youtuber; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie" target="_blank"> PewDiePie</a> , but that's a completely different story. Anyway, I fell In love with the game, and I kept watching other people play. And then some people created a series of similar games that use the same engine as Slender, and have Slenderman as the enemy. And fortunately, It worked just fine on my laptop. And believe me, playing the game is <strong> very </strong> different.
    And this year, the original Slender creators released another slender game called <a href="http://www.slenderarrival.com/â€Ž" target="_blank"><i>Slender: The Arrival</i></a>. And this one, is <i>so</i> much scarier, it has a storyline and levels. Unfortunate, it didn't run on my computer properly. But I'm still on the lookout for a new opportunity to be terrified by The Slender Man.

      innovations that revolutionize artificial intelligence, dribbling, ball control and physical play,<br>
      FIFA 2013 represents the largest and deepest feature set in the history of the franchise. <br>

    <p class="fifadiscription">
        The FIFA video-game series are on of the most famous video-game series if not <i><strong>the</strong></i> most famous. Before I started playing FIFA 13, I used to play PES, the reason I started playing FIFA is because we had a FIFA tournament in my school. So, in order for me to participate, I had to actually play the game. Ss I downloaded the free demo and started playing, and I found out It was much more enjoyable for me than PES. FIFA also has a very nice game mode called "Ultimate team" where you create your own squad from real life players, and as you play matches, you gain cash to buy new players, trade with other FIFA players across the globe, and create the "Ultimate Team".

        I first watched Pewdipie when I was looking for Slender videos, and when I first watched him I thought: Who is this guy, and why is he making these funny reactions. So I investigated his channel, and he turned out to be the funniest guy I've ever seen. He is a Swedish guy who plays video-games, he currently has over 9.5 million subscribers who he calls his "Bros", and his channel is the second most subscribed channel on Youtube. The number of times he has turned my day around from sad and boring to happy is uncountable, he is a really great guy and you should checkout his channel.

            <img src="yaserpic.jpg" class="yaserpic" alt=" A picture of Yaser">
            <p class="yaserdiscription"> I first met Yaser in 8<sup>th</sup> grade , I actually don't remember how we did it, but we ended up being best friends. The best thing about Yaser is that he can become as childish and playful as a 5-year-old when we hang out, and he can be as serious as a professional businessman when we have school work together. He is very good at biology and he made several dissections in the school in front of other students. He is a very respectful person, and he is one of my best friends.

And together with Yaser we are the most known trio in the school, because of the work we put in the school council. He is a really funny guy, and we worked on several projects together. He really likes graphic designing, and he has some fantastic 3-D designs, he also gave courses to the students in our school on 3-D designing. He is a smart guy, and one of my best friends.
